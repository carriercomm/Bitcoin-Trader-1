What is Bitcoin Trader by MtGox Live?
MtGox Live Bitcoin Trader is an Android Application that helps you buy, sell, trade, and send bitcoins on MtGox.
It also has many more features, including depth history, user history, as well as many more features that will
be pushed daily.


Why is the source code here?
The source code allows you to download, review, compile and install the software on your device if you do not
wish to install a precompiled binary.  However, most users will opt in downloading the precompiled binary from:

https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mtgoxlive.trader (v1.2 / current)

We are constantly updating the code base (e.g., multiple times daily).  Expect many great tools, additions,
visualizations and more to come!  We will also be adding iPhone support soon!


Why Appcelerator Titanium / Javascript?
Portability.  Readability.  By utilizing Appcelerator Titanium, we are able to reach the widest array of 
devices while maintaining a single code base.  This means less work for us to create more benefit for 
people everywhere!


Why is this free?
Let's make this world a better place, one step at a time.

How to read:
                app.js
                   \
                   topWindow.js -> passwordWindow.js, registerWindow.js, loginWindow.js
                                                                              |
                                                                          mainWindow.js

From there, mainWindow.js is the main window and all the other windows are sub windows
within mainWindow (or in Titanium language, mainWindow is the main window and the
rest of the views are simply Views within the Window).


How to install:
1. Get Android SDK from http://developer.android.com/index.html
2. Follow instructions to install Android SDK and Eclipse
